# Project \#1: An Image Processing System

This project is your first larger parallel program. You will likely use locks,
waitgroups, and atomic variables. You will also identify performance
bottlenecks and practice the use of Amdahl's law and speedup factors.

## The general idea

Your task is to create an image editor that will apply image effects on series
of images using 2D image convolutions.  Many algorithms in image processing
benefit from parallelization (especially those that run on GPUs). You will
create an image processing system that runs on a CPU.
You will be asked to create three implementations: a sequential baseline version,
a version that processes multiple images in parallel (but each image is processed
sequentially), and a version that parallelizes the processing of each image.

## Preliminaries

 If you are unfamiliar
with image convolutions then you should read over the following sources before
beginning the assignment:

-   [Two Dimensional
    Convolution](http://www.songho.ca/dsp/convolution/convolution2d_example.html)
-   [Image Processing using
    Convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing))

The locations of input and output images, as well as the effects to apply will
be communicated to your program using the JSON format. If you are unfamiliar
with the JSON standard then you should read up on it before beginning the
assignment. JSON is a widely used serialization format that you will mostly
encounter at some point in your career. Thus, it's better that you learn it now
so you can be comfortable with it in the future. How to work with JSON data
inside Go is described here:

  - [JSON in Go](https://blog.golang.org/json)

## Program Usage

Your program will read from a series of JSON strings, where each string
represents an image along with the effects that should be applied to that
image. Each string will have the following format,

``` json
{ 
  "inPath": string, 
  "outPath": string, 
  "effects": [string] 
}
```

For example, processing an image of a sky may have the following JSON
string,

``` json
{ 
  "inPath": "sky.png", 
  "outPath": "sky_out.png",  
  "effects": ["S","B","E"]
}
```

where each key-value is described in the table below,

| Key-Value                     | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| ``"inPath":"sky.png"``        | The ``"inPath"`` pairing represents the file path of the image to read in. Images in  this assignment will always be PNG files. All images are relative to the ``data`` directory inside the ``proj1`` folder. |
| ``"outPath:":"sky_out.png"``  | The ``"outPath"`` pairing represents the file path to save the image after applying the effects. All images are relative to the ``data`` directory inside the ``proj1`` folder. |
| ``"effects":["S"\,"B"\,"E"]`` | The ``"effects"`` pairing  represents the image effects to apply to the image. You must apply these in the order they are listed. If no effects are specified (e.g.\, ``[]``) then the out image is the same as the input image. |

The program will read in the images, apply the effects associated with
an image, and save the images to their specified output file paths. How
the program processes this file is described in the **Program
Specifications** section.

## Image Effects

The sharpen, edge-detection, and blur image effects are required to use
image convolution to apply their effects to the input image.
The size of the input and output image
are fixed (i.e., they are the same). Thus, results around the border
pixels will not be fully accurate because you will need to pad zeros
where inputs are not defined. You are required to use the a zero-padding
when working with pixels that are not defined. **You may not use a
library or external source to perform the convolution for you. You must
implement the convolution code yourself**. The grayscale effect uses a
simple algorithm defined below that does not require convolution.

Each effect is identified by a single character that is described below,

| Image Effect | Description |
| -------------|-------------|
| ``"S"`` | Performs a sharpen effect with the following kernel (provided as a flat go array): ``[9]float6 {0,-1,0,-1,5,-1,0,-1,0}``. |
| ``"E"`` | Performs an edge detection effect with the following kernel (provided as a flat go array): ``[9]float64{-1,-1,-1,-1,8,-1,-1,-1,-1}``. |
| ``"B"`` | Performs a blur effect with the following kernel (provided as a flat go array): ``[9]float64{1 / 9.0, 1 / 9, 1 / 9.0, 1 / 9.0, 1 / 9.0, 1 / 9.0, 1 / 9.0, 1 / 9.0, 1 / 9.0}``. |
| ``"G"`` | Performs a grayscale effect on the image. This is done by averaging the values of all three color numbers for a pixel, the red, green and blue, and then replacing them all by that average. So if the three colors were 25, 75 and 250, the average would be 116, and all three numbers would become 116. |

## The `data` Directory

Inside the `proj1` directory, You will need to download the `data`
directory here:

-   [Proj 1
    Data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cwse3i736ejcxpe/data.zip?dl=0) :
    There should be a download arrow icon on the left side to download
    the zip folder.

Place this directory inside the `proj1` directory that contains the
subdirectories: `editor` and `png`. **DO NOT COMMIT THIS DIRECTORY TO
YOUR REPOSITORY**. These are very large files and committing this
directory will result in a penalty!

Here is the structure of the `data` directory:

| Directory/Files | Description  |
|-----------------|--------------|
| ``effects.txt`` |  This is the file that contains the string of JSONS that were described above. This will be the only file used for this program (and also for testing purposes). You must use a relative path to your ``proj1`` directory to open this file. For example, if you open this file from the ``editor.go`` file then you should open as ``../data/effects.txt``. |
|  ``expected`` directory | This directory contains the expected filtered out image for each JSON string provided in the ``effects.txt``. We will only test your program against the images provided in this directory. Your  produced images do not need to look 100% like the provided output. If there are some slight differences based on rounding-error then that's fine for full credit. |
|  ``in`` directory | This directory contains three subdirectories called: ``big``, ``mixture``, and ``small``. The actual images in each of these subdirectories are all the same, with the exception of their *image sizes*. The ``big`` directory has the best resolution of the images, ``small`` has a reduced resolution of the images, and the ``mixture`` directory has a mixture of both big and small sizes for different images. You must use a relative path to your ``proj1`` directory to open this file. For example, if you want to open the ``IMG_2029.png`` from the ``big`` directory from inside the ``editor.go`` file then you should open as ``../data/in/big/IMG_2029.png``. |
| ``out`` directory | This is where you will place the ``outPath`` images when running the program. |

### Working with Images in Go and Startup Code

As part of the Go standard library, an `image` package is provided that
makes it easy to load,read,and save PNG images. I recommend looking at
the examples from these links:

-   [Go PNG docs](https://golang.org/pkg/image/png/)
-   A [helpful
    tutorial](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/working-images-go) for
    working on png images. Make sure to cite this website, if you are
    going to use a similar structure to the code provided. The developer
    directly accesses the `Pix` buffer. I would recommend you use the
    `At()` and `Set()` methods as specified by the Go PNG documentation.

> **Note**:
> The image package only allows you to read an image data and not modify
> it in-place. You will need to create a separate out buffer to represent
> the modified pixels. We have done this for you already in the `Image`
> struct as follows:

``` go
type Image struct {
  in  *image.RGBA64  // Think about swapping these between effects 
  out *image.RGBA64  // Think about swapping these between effects 
  Bounds  image.Rectangle
  ... 
} 
```

Feel free to reuse or modify this in your implementation. Remember these are
**pointers** so you only need to swap the pointers to make the old out buffer
the new in buffer when applying one effect after another effect.  This process
is less expensive than copying pixel data after apply each effect.

To help you get started, I provide code for loading, saving, performing
the grayscale effect on a png image. You are not required to use this
code and you can modify it as you wish. This code is already inside the
`proj1/sample/sample.go` directory. You can run this sample program by
going into the `proj1/sample` directory typing in the following command:

    $: go run sample.go test_img.png 

## Program Specifications

For this project, You will implement three versions of this image
processing system. The versions will include a sequential version and
two parallel versions.

The running of these various versions have already been setup for you
inside the `proj1/editor/editor.go` file.

The `data_dir` argument will always be either `big`, `small`, or
`mixture` or a combination between them. The program will always read
from the `data/effects.txt` file; however, the `data_dir` argument
specifies which directory to use. The user can also add a `+` to perform
the effects on multiple directories. For example, `big` will apply the
`effects.txt` file on the images coming from the `big` directory. The
argument `big+small` will apply the `effects.txt` file on both the `big`
and `small` directory. The program must always prepend the `data_dir`
identifier to the beginning of the `outPath`. For example, running the
program as follows:

    $: go run editor.go big bsp 4 

will produce inside the `out` directory the following files:

    big_IMG_2020_Out.png 
    big_IMG_2724_Out.png 
    big_IMG_3695_Out.png 
    big_IMG_3696_Out.png 
    big_IMG_3996_Out.png 
    big_IMG_4061_Out.png 
    big_IMG_4065_Out.png
    big_IMG_4066_Out.png 
    big_IMG_4067_Out.png
    big_IMG_4069_Out.png

Here's an example of a combination run:

    $: go run editor.go big+small pipeline 2

will produce inside the `out` directory the following files:

    big_IMG_2020_Out.png 
    big_IMG_2724_Out.png 
    big_IMG_3695_Out.png 
    big_IMG_3696_Out.png 
    big_IMG_3996_Out.png 
    big_IMG_4061_Out.png 
    big_IMG_4065_Out.png
    big_IMG_4066_Out.png 
    big_IMG_4067_Out.png
    big_IMG_4069_Out.png
    small_IMG_2020_Out.png 
    small_IMG_2724_Out.png 
    small_IMG_3695_Out.png 
    small_IMG_3696_Out.png 
    small_IMG_3996_Out.png 
    small_IMG_4061_Out.png 
    small_IMG_4065_Out.png
    small_IMG_4066_Out.png 
    small_IMG_4067_Out.png
    small_IMG_4069_Out.png

We will always provide valid command line arguments so you will only be
given at most 3 specified identifiers for the `data_dir` argument. A
single `+` will always be used to separate the identifiers with no
whitespace.

The `mode` and `number_of_threads` arguments will be used to run one of
the parallel versions. Parts 2 and 3 will discuss these arguments in
more detail. If the `mode` and `number_of_threads` arguments are not
provided then the program will default to running the sequential
version, which is discussed in Part 1.

The scheduling (i.e., running) of the various implementations is handled
by the `scheduler` package defined in `proj1/scheduler` directory. The
`editor.go` program will create a configuration object (similar to
project 1) using the following struct:

``` go
type Config struct {
  DataDirs string //Represents the data directories to use to load the images.
  Mode     string // Represents which scheduler scheme to use
  ThreadCount int // Runs in parallel with this number of threads
}
```

The `Schedule` function inside the `proj1/scheduler/scheduler.go` file
will then call the correct version to run based on the `Mode` field of
the configuration value. Each of the functions to begin running the
various implementation will be explained in the following sections.
**You cannot modify any of the code in the
\`\`proj1/scheduler/scheduler.go\`\` or \`\`proj1/editor/editor.go\`\`
file**.

**Additional Assumptions**: No error checking is needed to be done to
the strings coming in from *effects.txt*. You can assume the JSON
strings will contain valid values and provided in the format described
above. We will always provide the correct command line arguments and in
the correct order. The `expected` directory in `proj1/data` is based on
only running the small dataset. Thus, the resolution for mixture and big
modes will make the images appear slightly different. This is okay for
this assignment. We will always run/grade your solutions by going inside
the `proj1/editor` directory so loading in files should be relative to
that directory.

## Part 1: Sequential Implementation

Inside the `proj1/scheduler/sequential.go` file, implement the function:

``` go
func RunSequential(config Config) {

}
```

The sequential version is ran by default when executing the `editor`
program when the `mode` and `number_of_threads` are both not provided.
The sequential program is relatively straightforward. This version
should run through the images specified by the strings coming in from
`effects.txt`, apply their effects and save the modified images to their
output files inside the `data/out` directory. Make sure to prepend the
`data_dir` identifier.

> **Note**:
> You should implement the sequential version first. Make sure your code
> is **modular** enough such that you can potentially reuse functions/data
> structures later in your parallel version. Think about what libraries
> and functions should be created. **We will consider code and design style
> when grading this assignment**.

You may find this code useful:

``` go
effectsPathFile := fmt.Sprintf("../data/effects.txt")
effectsFile, _ := os.Open(effectsPathFile)
reader := json.NewDecoder(effectsFile)
```

## Part 2: Multiple Images in Parallel

The first parallel implementation will process multiple images in parallel,
but each individual image is handled by only one thread. The code should be
implemented as follows:

1.  Create a queue, where each node contains all information about the tasks
    related to an individual image (e.g. input file, output file, effects).
    You can either implement your own queue (e.g. as a linked list), or use an
    existing sequential data structure. The queue can be populated sequentially
    while reading the JSON input strings. It does not matter if your queue is
    FIFO or any other order.

2.  Spawn Go routines. The number of Go routines should be the
    number of threads specified in the command line, or the number of images in
    the queue (whichever is smaller). The Go routines should take image tasks
    from the queue and process them. You must implement your own TAS lock
    to safeguard accesses to the queue, i.e. items can only be taken out of the
    queue by a Go routine that holds the lock. **You cannot use any existing
    thread-safe queue datastructures or locks**.

3.  Go routines should run until all tasks from the queue are processed. The
    main program should wait until all Go routines have terminated. This is
    best implemented using a wait group; Please use the standard implementation
    provided by Go.

## Part 3: Parallelize Each Image

In the second parallel implementation, you will parallelize the processing of
individual images. For now, we assume that only one image is processed at a
time. This should be done as follows:

1.  Iterate over the same queue as in Part 2. For each image, spawn Go routines
    that operate on slices of the image. You will probably want to use slicing
    here, and take inspiration from the examples shown during class to compute the
    start and end index that each Go routine needs to work on.
2.  Let each Go routine apply effects to its own slice of the image.

3.  Only start working on the next image when the current image is fully
    processed. You can use waitgroups for this.

A performance hint about this part:

 -  Take care to minimize the amount of data copying, i.e. pass pointers or
    slices instead of copying chunks of data around all the time.

Convolutions have a slightly larger read set than write set, i.e. they read
from more indices than they write to. If multiple effects E1, E2, ... are
applied and slices are processed in parallel, you need to manage the fact that
the output of E1 in one slice affects the input of E2 in neighboring slices.
A few options come to mind (bonus points for coming up with new ones):

 - Use waitgroups so that nobody works on E2 before everyone has finished E1.
 - Give larger overlapping slices to Go routines, and let the slices shrink
   with each effect so that the output slices have just the right
   non-overlapping size when writing to the shared output.

Your grade will depend on the performance, which is affected by how well you
manage this fact and how well you avoid data copies. 

## Part 4: Performance Measurements and Speedup Graphs

Please measure the performance of your code on the Linux cluster, and report
your findings. You may measure program run times using terminal commands such
as `time`, by adding timers to your code similar to what you saw in the
examples presented during class, and/or by wrapping everything in a Python
script and using Python's timing functions. You may use a combination of multiple
approaches.


1. Using just one thread, measure the overall time of your program, as well as
   the time spent in the program parts that you are parallelizing. After obtaining
   these numbers, use Amdahl's law to determine the speedup that you are expecting
   for `{2,4,6,8,12}` threads. I want to see the original numbers and how you
   used the formula to obtain the results. It is probably easiest if you create a
   spreadsheet and submit this with your project, but it is also fine to write
   the calculation step by step in your report.
   You will observe that timings vary a little bit each time you run your program.
   Please run every experiment at least 5 times, and use the best-observed time
   from those runs.

2. Use the same numbers and Amdahl's law to determine the speedup you might get
   in the limit, with an infinite number of threads.

3. Create speedup graphs. The y-axis will list the speedup measurement
   and the x-axis will list the number of threads. As a reminder, the speedup is
   the time for one thread, divided by the time for N threads.

4.   Make make sure to title the graph, and label each axis.
   Make sure to adjust your y-axis range so that we can accurately see
   the values. That is, if most of your values fall between a range of
   \[0,1\] then don't make your speedup range \[0,14\].

5.  We will keep things simple and only look at
   measuring single data directories: `small`, `mixture`, and `big`. Each speedup graph is based around a single parallel version
   (e.g., `slice`) where each line represents running a specific data
   directory. The set of threads will be `{2,4,6,8,12}` and will remain the
   same for all speedup graphs.

    Here's an example of a speedup graph:

    ![image](./speedup-bsp.png)

    **Your graph may look vastly different from mine and that's okay!**.
    It's fine if the lines vary from thread to thread or look odd.
    However, to receive a good performance grade, most of the lines must have
    speedups.

6.  The names for each graph file will be the name of the parallel
    versions (i.e., `speedup-slice.png` and `speedup-images.png`)

6.  All your work for this section must be placed in the `benchmark`
    directory along with the generated speedup graphs. Modify the
    `benchmark-proj1.sh` script so that it contains all commands (or calls
    another script that does) to reproduce your timings and your plot, i.e. the
    experiment should be fully automated with just calling the benchmark script as

    `sbatch benchmark-proj1.sh`


## Part 5: Performance Analysis

Please submit a report (pdf document, text file, etc.) summarizing your
results from the experiments and the conclusions you draw from them.
Your report should **also** include the graphs as specified above and an
analysis of the graphs. That is, somebody should be able to read the
report alone and understand what code you developed, what experiments
you ran and how the data supports the conclusions you draw. The report
**must** also include the following:

-   A brief description of the project. A paragraph or two recap will
    suffice.

-   Instructions on how to run your testing script. We should be able to
    just say `sbatch benchmark-proj1.sh`; however, if we need to do
    another step then please let us know in the report.

-   As stated previously, you need to explain the results of your graph. Based on your implementation why are you getting those results? Answers the following questions:  
    -   What are the **hotspots** and **bottlenecks** in your sequential
        program?
    -   Which parallel implementation is performing better? Why do you
        think it is?
    -   Does the problem size (i.e., the data size) affect performance?
    -   How close are your programs to the expected speedup computed with
        Amdahl's law? If they are not close, why?

-   Based on the topics we discussed in class, identify the areas in
    your implementation that could hypothetically see increases in
    performance (if any). Explain why you would see those increases.


## Grading

Programming assignments will be graded according to a general rubric.
Specifically, we will assign points for completeness, correctness,
design, and style. For this assignment, the weights will be:

-   **Sequential Version** 10%
-   **Each Parallel Version:** 25%
-   **Design & Style:** 10%
-   **Performance:** 15%
-   **Analysis Report:** 15%

There are no automated tests for this assignment. We will manually run
your programs to verify visually with comparing your results to the
expected output directory. You will be provided with partial credit if
your program is not deterministic.

## Design, Style and Cleaning up

Before you submit your final solution, you should remove

-   any `Printf` statements that you added for debugging purposes and
-   all in-line comments of the form: "YOUR CODE HERE" and "TODO ..."
-   Think about your function decomposition. No code duplication. This
    homework assignment is relatively small so this shouldn't be a major
    problem but could be in certain problems.

Go does not have a strict style guide. However, use your best judgment
from prior programming experience about style. Did you use good variable
names? Do you have any lines that are too long, etc.

As you clean up, you should periodically save your file and run your
code through the tests to make sure that you have not broken it in the
process.

## Submission

Before submitting, make sure you’ve added, committed, and pushed all
your code to GitHub. You must submit your final work through Gradescope
(linked from our Canvas site) in the "Project \#1" assignment page via
two ways,

1.  **Uploading from Github directly (recommended way)**: You can link
    your Github account to your Gradescope account and upload the
    correct repository based on the homework assignment. When you submit
    your homework, a pop window will appear. Click on "Github" and then
    "Connect to Github" to connect your Github account to Gradescope.
    Once you connect (you will only need to do this once), then you can
    select the repository you wish to upload and the branch (which
    should always be "main" or "master") for this course.
2.  **Uploading via a Zip file**: You can also upload a zip file of the
    homework directory. Please make sure you upload the entire directory
    and keep the initial structure the **same** as the starter code;
    otherwise, you run the risk of not passing the automated tests.

As a reminder, for this assignment, there will be **no autograder** on
Gradescope. We will run the program the CS Peanut cluster and manually
enter in the grading into Gradescope. However, you **must still submit
your final commit to Gradescope**.
